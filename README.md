# Konane
Fiddling around with making a Konane client in Swift.

Currently 90% functional as a two-player pass and play game. The only issue I haven't addressed yet is to make sure it doesn't test for possible moves outside the boundaries of the board. That's currently a fatal error, I'll correct that next.

Oh, and it's also currently a hack-job, but one thing at a time.
